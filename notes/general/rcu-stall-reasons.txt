# REASONS FOR A RCU STALL

* A CPU looping in an RCU read-side critical section.

* A CPU looping with interrupts disabled. This condition canresult in
  RCU-sched and RCU-bh stalls.

* A CPU looping with preemption disabled. This s in use, RCU-bhstalls.

* A CPU looping with bottom halves disabled. This condition canresult in
  RCU-sched and RCU-bh stalls.

* For !CONFIG_PREEMPT kernels, a CPU looping anywhere in the kernel without
  invoking schedule(). Note that cond_resched() does not necessarily
  prevent RCU CPU stall warnings. Therefore, if the looping in the kernel
  is really expected and desirable behavior, you might need to replace some
  of the cond_resched() calls with calls to cond_resched_rcu_qs().

* Booting Linux using a console connection that is too slow to keep up with
  the boot-time console-message rate. For example, a 115Kbaud serial
  console can be -way- too slow to keep up with boot-time message rates,
  and will frequently result in RCU CPU stall warning messages.
  Especially if you have added debug printk()s.

* Anything that prevents RCU's grace-period kthreads from running. This
  can result in the "All QSes seen" console-log message. This message
  will include information on when the kthread last ran and how often it
  should be expected to run.

* A CPU-bound real-time task in a CONFIG_PREEMPT kernel, which might happen
  to preempt a low-priority task in the middle of an RCU read-side critical
  section. This is especially damaging if that low-priority task is not
  permitted to run on any other CPU, in which case the next RCU grace
  period can never complete, which will eventually cause the system to run
  out of memory and hang. While the system is in the process of running
  itself out of memory, you might see stall-warning messages.

* A CPU-bound real-time task in a CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT kernel that is running
  at a higher priority than the RCU softirq threads. This will prevent
  RCU callbacks from ever being invoked, and in a CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU kernel
  will further prevent RCU grace periods from ever completing. Either
  way, the system will eventually run out of memory and hang. In the
  CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU case, you might see stall-warning messages.

* A hardware or software issue shuts off the scheduler-clock interrupt on a
  CPU that is not in dyntick-idle mode. This problem really has happened,
  and seems to be most likely to result in RCU CPU stall warnings for
  CONFIG_NO_HZ_COMMON=n kernels.

* Bug in the RCU implementation.

* A hardware failure. This is quite unlikely, but has occurred at least
  once in real life. A CPU failed in a running system, becoming
  unresponsive, but not causing an immediate crash. This resulted in a
  series of RCU CPU stall warnings, eventually leading the realization that
  the CPU had failed.
